# TextureHeterogeneityDetection
We present an approach of Spatial Heterogeneity, e.i, Habitats, detection using texture information. First, We compute circular harmonic wavelets for small patches within a Region of Interest (RoI). Second, we cluster patches in order to define the sub-regions of an image with similar texture patterns (habitats). Finally, information about resulting clusters and their texture signatures is presented as habitat descriptors.

<b>Introduction</b><br>
This code is part of a project which results are published in the paper: "Revealing Tumor Habitats from Texture Heterogeneity Analysis for Classification of Lung Cancer Malignancy and Aggressiveness". Please, see the original paper for details:<br>

<b>Input Arguments</b><br>
There are three input variables. The first is a 2D image. The second is a mask (RoI) for the image. The third is Harmonic Vector description.<br>
The image (img) can be represented by any data type. There are no requirements for pixel value range or type.<br>
The RoI (mask) has to have the same resolution as the input image. Non-zero elements represent an RoI where heterogeneity should be evaluated.<br>
The Harmonic Vector (hV) represents the complexity and the number of a “convolution kernels”. All operations are done in Fourier space, so you may think about them as representatives of convolution kernels. The simplest texture description represented by 0. Next is -1 and 1 and so on. Thus, you can set hV to (0), (-1, 0), (-1, 0, 1), ..., (-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and so on. For more details see papers in the reference section.<br>

<b>Output Arguments</b><br>

Habitat detection algorithm produces two outputs.<br><br>
<i>"Habitats"</i>: NxXxY matrix, where N is number of detected habitats, X and Y are resolutions of the input image. Each habitat is marked with non-zero elements in an individual habitat map. Function workflow/show_habitats.m can be used for displaying of combined map.<br><br>

"Features": Structure variable containing description of habitats and tumor heterogeneity.<br>
"Features.num_clusters": number of detected habitats;<br>
"Features.fingerprint": texture signature values for each habitat. The order of signatures is the same as the order of habitat maps in "Habitats" output.<br>
"Features.q_features": Stracture field which describe statistical information about habitat areas.<br>
"Features.q_features.smallest_ration_v": The smallest ratio of a habitat area to an RoI area.<br>
"Features.q_features.largest_region_v": The largest ratio of a habitat area to an RoI area.<br>
"Features.q_features.mean_region_v": The mean ratio of a habitat area to an RoI area.<br>
"Features.q_features.median_region_v": The median ratio of a habitat area to an RoI area.<br>
"Features.q_features.disjoint_smallest_ration_v": The smallest ratio of a disjoint* habitat area to an RoI area.<br>
"Features.q_features.disjoint_largest_region_v": The largest ratio of a disjoint* habitat area to an RoI area.<br>
"Features.q_features.disjoint_mean_region_v": The mean ratio of a disjoint* habitat area to an RoI area.<br>
"Features.q_features.disjoint_median_region_v": The median ratio of a disjoint* habitat area to an RoI area.<br>
"Features.centroids_mean_dist": Mean euclidean distance from each habitat texture signature to a RoI texture signature. The RoI texture signature is defined as mean value of all texture signatures.<br>
"Features.centroids_std_dist": Standart deviation of euclidean distances from each habitat texture signature to a RoI texture signature. The RoI texture signature is defined as mean value of all texture signatures.<br><br>


*Habitats are detected without the respect to their location within an RoI. As a result, an individual habitat can be presented as set of disjoint sub-regions within an RoI. In case where area statistics is computed on disjoint habitats each disjoint region of a habitat is considered as an independent habitat.<br>




<b>Patient cohort processing</b><br>

During processing a dataset of images it is important to fulfill the following requirements.<br><br>
Uniform spatial resolution. Medical image spatial resolution depends on a patient. For consistency of habitat detection across patients it is important to make spatial resulution uniform.<br><br>
Uniform image size. Texture computation is performed in the frequency space after the fourier transform. Varience in input image sizes will cause difference in texture signature computation and as a result drop in texture signatures comparability.<br><br>
Minimum data outside RoI. The result of the fourier transform depends on a content of an input image. <br><br>
